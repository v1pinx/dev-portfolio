# My Personal Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Built with **Next.js** and sprinkled with some **AOS** animations for that extra pizzazz, this portfolio is where I flex my coding muscles and pretend to be a professional. 😎

## Features 🎨
- Smooth animations that make everything look fancy (thanks, AOS!).
- A dark mode because light mode burns my eyes. 🌚
- Showcasing my projects, skills, and maybe some embarrassing fun facts.
- Responsive design so it looks great on your grandma’s phone too!

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Animations:** AOS
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (because I'm too lazy for custom CSS)

## Contributing 🙃
Sure, if you find something broken, fix it and send me a PR. I promise to look at it... eventually. 😆
